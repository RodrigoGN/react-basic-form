# React Basic Form

Creating a basic form to develop skills:

- Use of Components

- State

- Props

- Submitting form data

- API

- deploy React on Gitpages

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

To deploy the page to the branch `gh-pages`
